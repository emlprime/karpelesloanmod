We help people stay in their homes. \r\n\r\nDue to the extremely large number of home foreclosures lenders currently face, they are more willing than ever to negotiate with homeowners to modify home loans.  This means we can negotiate lower interest rates, reduce your monthly payments, recapitalize missed payments, or sometimes even lower the principal on your home loan.   \r\n\r\nIf a loan modification is not possible, we can also help you before and during the foreclosure process in other vital ways.  A \u201cshort sale\u201d of your home, for instance, will allow you to settle with the bank for less than the amount left to be paid on your mortgage, allowing you to avoid the blight of a foreclosure on your credit record, and allowing the lender to avoid the expense of foreclosure proceedings. \r\n\r\nUnder a new law passed by the Obama administration, a homeowner who opts for a short sale can receive up to $3,000 in moving expenses, which can also make this option attractive to many borrowers. \r\n\r\nDepending on your situation, other solutions might also be available, such as a deed transfer in lieu of foreclosure, which will allow you to move out of the home on your own terms.

By filing Chapter 7, you completely discharge, or wipe out, most forms of debt.  In exchange, your creditors receive the proceeds from a liquidation of qualifying assets by the bankruptcy trustee.  However, you are entitled to keep many of your personal and business assets under California law\u2014including your car, furniture, and sometimes even your home\u2014making a Chapter 7 bankruptcy an appealing option if you qualify for this type of bankruptcy relief.\r\n\r\nA Chapter 7 bankruptcy will enable you to eliminate credit card debt, judgments, medical bills and other types of debt and move forward with your life while retaining all the exempt assets necessary to continuing your day-to-day life.  Chapter 7 bankruptcies also allow owners of failed businesses to close down their operations quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nChapter 7 bankruptcy is a good option when you have too much debt, you have too many creditors for debt settlement, and your only significant assets can be protected through the exemptions provided for in California law for necessities like clothing, transportation, and shelter.  Our lawyers can determine which type of bankruptcy is the best debt solution for you or your business."

A business that files for Chapter 11 is given time and leverage to renegotiate debt with uncooperative creditors, and get out of burdensome leases or contracts.\r\n\r\nChapter 11 is designed for businesses that have too many creditors to negotiate individual debt settlements with each.  It is also normally an option only when your business is likely to be able to continue operating and turning a profit if provided with a restructured debt pay-off plan. \r\n\r\nBusinesses are usually allowed to continue to operate while in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, though they must do so under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court can force debt pay-off terms on creditors even when they oppose the terms proposed by the business in bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nWe can help you determine if a Chapter 11 reorganization is right for your business and guide you through this complex and often difficult, but rewarding, process.

If you meet the qualifications for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, this type of filing has the advantage of allowing you to restructure your debts and pay them off completely within a specific period, usually 3 to 5 years, after which all of your debts, with certain exceptions, will be completely discharged, or wiped out. \r\n\r\nChapter 13 bankruptcies also have the advantage of enabling you to possibly strip away any second or third mortgage taken out on your home if there is no equity in the home beyond what is owed on the first mortgage. \r\n\r\nIn addition, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can enable you to catch up on past due mortgage payments and keep your home.  One of the major legislative proposals being discussed by the Obama administration involves the rewriting and reducing of loans on residences where the home has lost considerable value and is \u201cunderwater\u201d\u2014that is, its appraised value is less than the amount due on the mortgage.
